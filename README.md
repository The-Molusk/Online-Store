## Why?
This store was orignally created in tandem with an older video game project, but after realising how large of an undertaking it was for one person, i greatly scaled down the development size of the game. While i do not have plans for a store in my <a href="https://github.com/Tidod/Space-Game">current game project</a>, this program may be still useful in the future.
